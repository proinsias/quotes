> People are more benign than the common few supposes. Circumstances are much more malignant.

> Meritocratic inequality does not in fact certain anyone well, that's keeping the meritocracy trap with therefore benefit virtually everyone. Emancipation would invite the Elite, now entangled in strained self exploitation, to trade domination in wealth and status that it can easily afford an exchange for precious increase in leisure in liberty, reclaiming of an authentic self.
>
> Rising economic inequality mostly stems not from capital's increasing dominance over labor but rather from these superordinate workers' increasing dominance over middle-class workers. Rising inequality is not driven principally by villains and moralistic act attacks on bad actors neglect morally complex but massively more consequential structural wrongs. Indeed, the commonplace objections to rising economic equality undermine themselves.

> Feels better to be at the center of your own for society and on the margins of someone else's richer one.

> Meritocratic inequality also undermines the mid century unity of ideals. meritocracy connects income to education and, through education, to work family culture and even Place, giving economic differences new dimensions of quality as well as quantity. This comprehensive Divide prevents the rich and the rest from even imagining an ideal of the common good that they might share across caste boundaries.
>
> Systematic studies reveal that law and policy respond sensitivity to elite preferences while remaining almost totally unresponsive to the Preferences of everyone else. Even when the middle class and the poor unite against the rich, policy adjusts to the preferences of the rich and ignores the shared Preferences of the middle-class and the poor. Economic inequality begets political inequality, and meritocracy undermines democracy.
>
> Meritocracy places the state and private elites into direct competition for the same basic asset (the human capital of superordinate workers) and for the same basic virtues ( skill effort and industry). Present-day American state struggles to resist the private influence of wealth that competes directly for superordinate labor.
>
> Elites detach from society whose political support they no longer need and become an modestly sure of their own virtues. meanwhile, the working and middle-classes embrace populist anger and nativist resentment, rejecting expertise and institutions and assailling things foreign and unfamiliar.
>
> Elite society forgives and even ignores selfishness, intemperance, cruelty, and other long recognized biases, but bigotry and prejudice, if exposed, can end a career.
>
> American meritocracy has become precisely what it was invented to combat: a mechanism for the concentration and dynastic transmission ofwealth, privilege, and caste across generations. A social and economic hierarchy with these comprehensive, dynastic, and self-referential qualities has a name: an aristocracy. And meritocracy does not dismantle but rather renovates aristocracy, fashioning a new caste order, contrived for a world in which wealth consists not in land or factories but rather in human capital, the free labor of skilled workers.
>
> Industry displaces breeding as the ground of privilege, and meritocratic education displaces aristocratic inheritance as the central dynastic technology. Elite skills are hard-won in the new order, and superordinate workers' industry is real, just as breeding and manners once set aristocrats genuinely apart. Like aristocracy, moreover, meritocracy purports to construct a social
>
> order that is not simply unequal but justly unequal. And as aristocracy's ideals once did, so meritocracy's claims about virtue and desert today persuade not just the privileged elite but also—ambivalently and unhappily, to be sure— the many whom meritocracy excludes.
>
> But merit's allure is an illusion. Because the meritocrat's skills are valuable only against a backdrop of prior economic inequality, efforts to justify inequality based on the value, or merit, of these skills succumb to the fallacy of circular reasoning. Like the aristocratic values that it replaces, merit is not a natural or universal virtue but rather the upshot ofprior inequalities. Merit is an artificial construction, built to valorize the exploitation of human capital, and, in this way, to launder an otherwise offensive distribution of advantage.
