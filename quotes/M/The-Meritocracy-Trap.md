> People are more benign than the common few supposes. Circumstances are much more malignant.
>
> Meritocratic inequality does not in fact certain anyone well, that's keeping the meritocracy trap with therefore benefit virtually everyone. Emancipation would invite the Elite, now entangled in strained self exploitation, to trade domination in wealth and status that it can easily afford an exchange for precious increase in leisure in liberty, reclaiming of an authentic self.
>
> Rising economic inequality mostly stems not from capital's increasing dominance over labor but rather from these superordinate workers' increasing dominance over middle-class workers. Rising inequality is not driven principally by villains and moralistic act attacks on bad actors neglect morally complex but massively more consequential structural wrongs. Indeed, the commonplace objections to rising economic equality undermine themselves.
>
> Feels better to be at the center of your own for society and on the margins of someone else's richer one.
>
> Meritocratic inequality also undermines the mid century unity of ideals. meritocracy connects income to education and, through education, to work family culture and even Place, giving economic differences new dimensions of quality as well as quantity. This comprehensive Divide prevents the rich and the rest from even imagining an ideal of the common good that they might share across caste boundaries.
>
> Systematic studies reveal that law and policy respond sensitivity to elite preferences while remaining almost totally unresponsive to the Preferences of everyone else. Even when the middle class and the poor unite against the rich, policy adjusts to the preferences of the rich and ignores the shared Preferences of the middle-class and the poor. Economic inequality begets political inequality, and meritocracy undermines democracy.
>
> Meritocracy places the state and private elites into direct competition for the same basic asset (the human capital of superordinate workers) and for the same basic virtues ( skill effort and industry). Present-day American state struggles to resist the private influence of wealth that competes directly for superordinate labor.
>
> Elites detach from society whose political support they no longer need and become an modestly sure of their own virtues. meanwhile, the working and middle-classes embrace populist anger and nativist resentment, rejecting expertise and institutions and assailling things foreign and unfamiliar.
>
> Elite society forgives and even ignores selfishness, intemperance, cruelty, and other long recognized biases, but bigotry and prejudice, if exposed, can end a career.
>
> American meritocracy has become precisely what it was invented to combat: a mechanism for the concentration and dynastic transmission ofwealth, privilege, and caste across generations. A social and economic hierarchy with these comprehensive, dynastic, and self-referential qualities has a name: an aristocracy. And meritocracy does not dismantle but rather renovates aristocracy, fashioning a new caste order, contrived for a world in which wealth consists not in land or factories but rather in human capital, the free labor of skilled workers.
>
> Industry displaces breeding as the ground of privilege, and meritocratic education displaces aristocratic inheritance as the central dynastic technology. Elite skills are hard-won in the new order, and superordinate workers' industry is real, just as breeding and manners once set aristocrats genuinely apart. Like aristocracy, moreover, meritocracy purports to construct a social
>
> order that is not simply unequal but justly unequal. And as aristocracy's ideals once did, so meritocracy's claims about virtue and desert today persuade not just the privileged elite but also—ambivalently and unhappily, to be sure— the many whom meritocracy excludes.
>
> But merit's allure is an illusion. Because the meritocrat's skills are valuable only against a backdrop of prior economic inequality, efforts to justify inequality based on the value, or merit, of these skills succumb to the fallacy of circular reasoning. Like the aristocratic values that it replaces, merit is not a natural or universal virtue but rather the upshot ofprior inequalities. Merit is an artificial construction, built to valorize the exploitation of human capital, and, in this way, to launder an otherwise offensive distribution of advantage.
>
> He might have added that the paradox put his own governments moral  authority at risk:how could a society that condemned its poor to avoidable material misery and social exclusion legitimately expect them to remain loyal to its institutions and to obey its laws?
>
> The shift from low-to high-end inequality further hardens meritocratic inequality against conventional progressive arguments. Poverty endures, of course,and relief remains amoral imperative. But the War on Poverty (even if never completed) has transformed the political landscape. The politics of equality now focus on the growing relative gap between the top and the middle rather than on absolute need at the bottom-on frustration among the middle class rather than wretchedness among the poor. (Progressive nostalgia for the midcentury economy, when the middle class thrived while the poor suffered, symbolizes this shift.)
>
> The biggest losers from these developments, moreover, are not the poor, fo who (even in a democracy) face obstacles to concerted political action. Instead, the biggest losers-who have simultaneously suffered a declining income share and a rising share of the tax burden-have been the broad middle class. This group includes journalists, teachers and professors, middle managers, government workers, engineers, and even doctors in general practice. It is neither ill-educated nor disempowered but, to the contrary, can influence and possibly control the nation's medical and scientific establishment, its press, its universities, and even its most important bureaucracies.

> Today, Arthur C. Brooks, the president of the American Enterprise
>Institute, emphasizes that many of the concrete programs that
>progressives champion (including Social Security, Medicare, and
>subsidized college loans) distribute substantial portions of their
>benefits not to the poor but rather to the middle class.
>
> In all these ways, rich parents spend ever-greater sums on training their children, so that no facet of consumption inequality is increasing more rapidly than expenditure on education.
>
> Educational inequality has therefore increased markedly alongside rising income inequality. The gap between the test scores of high- and low-income students has grown by between 40 and 50 percent over the past twenty-five years, so that by the eighth grade, students from rich families are four grade levels ahead of those from poor ones. The achievement gap between rich and poor students in the United States today exceeds the present-day white/black achievement gap, which is three grade levels, and even exceeds the white/ black gap that racially segregated schools produced at midcentury.
